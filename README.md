Hi Hilary,

I forgot to add my Convergence experiment on my code last week. 

In order to run the code the following 3 scripts need to be run

Stability_cosBell.py - this will produce 3 plots with differing c values

Stability_squareWave.py - this is will produce 3 plots with differing c values

TotalVariationPlots.py - this is produce 2 plots one with a cos wave and the other square wave.

Convergence.py - runs the convergence plot.
