Great start

Feedback on your use of git:

1. You should do more regular commits with commit messages describing the recent code.

2. You need a .gitignore file and do not put binary files such as .pyc files into a git repository

Update the Readme files

You can put definitions of all of the schemes into advectionSchemes.py

Functions should always have docstrings describing what they do. See the guidelines at 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/yba7pj7woyvv7hs/goodCode.pdf?dl=1

Comments should describe the boundary conditions

Do not leave commented out code in your code

For CTCS, you should do one time step of a forward in time scheme (such s FTCS) to get phi at time 1 and then nt-1 time steps of CTCS

Change the name of the file "changeThisName.pdf" in python

The plot needs a legend

You will need to calculate more diagnostics analysing the behaviour of your schemes.

Also use the square wave initial conditions to compare how different schemes advect discontinuities.

You should also implement one of the schemes from chapter 6 of the notes to show that schemes exist that can do better than CTCS and FTBS
